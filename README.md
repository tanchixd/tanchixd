## 🧠 About Me

I am a deeply curious learner exploring the intersection of  
**Theoretical Physics • Mathematics • Computer Science • Philosophy of Science**.

I don’t chase surface-level knowledge.  
I break concepts down, rebuild them, and push until the *why* becomes obvious.

Curiosity fuels me. Rigor disciplines me.
